  storyText: 'You leave the kid and power on. There''s so many trees here. As you
    walk deeper into the forest you see some smoke coming from a hill? mountain? cave?


    This looks like paradise here, but back there looks like death. It''s kind of
    pulling you in.


    Should we keep going or go back as promised?


    1. Keep going

    2. Go back'
