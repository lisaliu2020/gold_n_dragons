  storyText: 'You grab a table close to the guys talking about the dragon.


    "My uncle told me how the dragon loves shiny objects. The dragon would do around
    and if he sees something shining he would come down and blow the entire town away."


    "Oh fu-. You know what I heard?? I heard the dragon eats all the live stock and
    leaves a burning trail behind."


    "God what has this come to how are we going to live? I hope the dragon doesn''t
    come here"


    THIS IS AMAZING. We can really test this sword out. This dragon sounds ferocious.


    Shall we set out?


    1. Walk to town gate

    2. Walk around town more'
