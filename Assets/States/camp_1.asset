  storyText: 'You find somewhere to camp out and make your bedding for the night.


    You slept well, but feeling a bit woozy this morning. There''s no blue sky to
    be seen. All you see is smog and ash covering the beautiful morning sun.


    You pack up and start walking towards town and something feels off. You realize
    that you''ve been poisioned.


    Ugh someone must have poisioned me last night when they saw me run away or maybe
    it was the mushrooms I picked. IS THIS KARMA?!


    What should I do??


    1. Head to doctor

    2. Keep walking towards town'
